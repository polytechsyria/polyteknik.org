      <p><b>Volunteers</b>: Our capacity for dealing with
      online contributors with questionable commitment
      is limited. We are mainly interested in people who
      want to come here and work with us. It entails large amounts of energy
      on our part to bring you here, look after you, give you the requisite
      training to be ready for work, so anybody contacting
      us to volunteer must be serious. Please fill out and send us

      <h3>What is polytechnics?</h3>
      <p>
        Lewis Mumford in the book "Technics and Civilization" introduced the key idea that technology was twofold:

        <ul>
            <li>
            Polytechnic, which enlists many different modes of technology, providing a complex framework to solve human problems.
            </li>

            <li>
            Monotechnic, which is technology only for its own sake, which oppresses humanity as it moves along its own trajectory.
            </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
